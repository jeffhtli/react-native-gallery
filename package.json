  "readme": "# react-native-gallery\r\n\r\nA pure JavaScript image gallery component for react-native apps with common gestures like pan, pinch and doubleTap, supporting both iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nThis component aims to be (one of ) the best image viewer for react-native apps. Comparing with other gallery alike components, this one should be more elegant in following aspects: (mimics iOS system photo album app)\r\n\r\n* Gesture handle: besides common pan, pinch and doubleTap, this component does well in targeting foucs point( or pivot) when zoom-in and zoom-out.\r\n* Responder switch: the gesture responder switch is more flexible than any other component, that is, the scrollable container and the wrapped image children perform well in acquiring and releasing gesture responder from/to each other.\r\n\r\nThis component works on react-native **0.28+** and only supports remote images for now.\r\n\r\n![](Demo/demo.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n`npm install --save react-native-gallery@latest`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentaion\r\n\r\nQuite easy to use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Gallery from 'react-native-gallery';\r\n...\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Gallery\r\n        style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black'}}\r\n        images={[\r\n          'http://p10.qhimg.com/t019e9cf51692f735be.jpg',\r\n          'http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/mw690/714a59a7tw1dxqkkg0cwlj.jpg',\r\n          'http://www.bz55.com/uploads/allimg/150122/139-150122145421.jpg'\r\n        ]}\r\n      />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis component utilizes **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)** as the scrollable container and **[react-native-transformable-image](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-transformable-image)** as the wrapped image. \r\n\r\n#### Props\r\n\r\n* **images**: array, contains image urls\r\n* **initialPage**, **pageMargin**, **onPageSelected**, **onPageScrollStateChanged**, **onPageScroll**: inherited from **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)**. Check the link for more details.\r\n* **onSingleTapConfirmed**: Called after user single taped( not a double tap)\r\n* **onGalleryStateChanged**: function. (idle) => {}.\r\n* **loader**: React component that will be displayed before each image has been loaded. For instance, you could use `ActivityIndicator`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add your custom views above image\r\n\r\nIt's a common practice to float a comment box or like button above the image. This component provides a convenient interface to implement this feature:\r\n\r\n- onSingleTapConfirmed(): a good time for you to display the responding floating view. \r\n- onGalleryStateChanged(idle): If *idle* is false, it's a good time for your to hide any floating views.\r\n\r\nCheck the Demo project for a simple demonstration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attention\r\n\r\nThis component is being actively developed but should be ready for production realease.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any problem that seems unnormal, just create an issue or check out the latest release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Dump off-screen images for better performance if needed",
